Hi, I'm Max. I am currently working as an actuarial analyst and studying for my IFoA exams. I am currently learning R, and have previously coded in Python, MATLAB and C++.

Please look through my Github at some projects I completed at university and then also some projects I have worked on since. 

Thanks!
